		Hi, I'm Simon from Team Krypton. Team Krypton was founded in 2022, although I've been building simple line followers with a Lego Mindstorms Ev3 since 2018.
		<br>
		We participated in RoboCup for the first time in February 2023; you can find all our runs on the EvB RoboCup YouTube channel. We achieved 3rd place, which unfortunately did not qualify us for the German Open in Kassel.
		<br>
		After RoboCup 2023, my friend left the team, but two others joined. We qualified for the German Open 2024 in Kassel and secured 42nd place.
		<br>
		Although we had hoped for more, we successfully used a Raspberry Pi in combination with a Pi camera to follow the line, which was our main goal for 2024.
		<br>
		<br>
		For 2025, we plan to improve everything, including collecting victims in the evacuation zone and much more...
		<br>
		So stay tuned!
